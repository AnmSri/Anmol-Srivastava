## About Me
I am a cybersecurity graduate student at Rowan University, with hands-on experience in cyber defense, risk analysis, and compliance. My academic background includes projects in SIEM implementation, log analysis, network monitoring, and vulnerability detection using tools like Splunk, Wireshark, Nmap, and Burp Suite.

I am ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity, a Scrum Master, and currently preparing to earn the CompTIA Security+ certification. Proficient in frameworks such as NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, GDPR, and MITRE ATT&CK, and skilled in technologies like Docker, Python, Bash, and Active Directory.

I approach cybersecurity with the mindset of a strategist, carefully analyzing risks, anticipating threats, and continuously improving defenses. Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess, which enhances my ability to think critically, plan ahead, and remain focused under pressure.
